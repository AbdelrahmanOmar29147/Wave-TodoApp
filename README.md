# Wave-TodoApp
Wanted to try using Typescript with ReactJS, therefore I tried building this calming app. This is a simple todo list application built using React and TypeScript.

## Features
* Add and delete tasks
* Mark tasks as completed
* Filter tasks by completion status
* Responsive design

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Miro29147/Wave-TodoApp.git
   ```

2. **Install the dependencies:**

   ```bash
   cd Wave-TodoApp/ts-react-todo
   npm install
   ```
   
 3. **Start the application:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   
4. **Open the application in your browser:**

   ```bash
   http://localhost:3000
   ```
